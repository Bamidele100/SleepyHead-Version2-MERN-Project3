        The app is basically designed to monitor, guide, track and checkmate any
        one that is workaholic or someone that has sleeping disorder. It is
        technically used by creating an account (login). Thereafter, the user
        will be directed to a page to input bed time and wake up time. The app
        will then calculate and displays value for the user. Equally, the app
        can output up to 5 days parameters for the same user if it is used
        within the last 5 days.
